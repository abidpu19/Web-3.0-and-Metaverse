/**
 * Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album.
 * The function should take in an artist name and an album title,
 * and it should return a Object containing these two pieces of information.
 * Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums.
 * Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the album information correctly.
 * Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album.
 * If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s Object.
 * Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.
